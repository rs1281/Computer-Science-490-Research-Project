Chronic Diseases - Data Analysis

Several nations are not meeting their worldwide obligations to reduce early mortality caused by chronic illnesses such as diabetes, lung cancer and chronic kidney disease. Chronic diseases are estimated, “to kill almost 41 million people a year worldwide” (O'Hare, 2020). 

The overarching objective of this literature review is to meticulously analyze and present extensive data 
and insights concerning chronic diseases, with a keen emphasis on three primary conditions: Diabetes, 
Chronic Kidney Disease, and Lung Cancer. Specifically, the aim is to investigate and elucidate the unique 
circumstances experienced by individual patients that contribute to the chronic nature of these diseases

Moreover, this review seeks to establish a robust foundation for the development of informative 
dashboards utilizing PowerBI. These dashboards will visually represent data related to the

aforementioned chronic diseases, providing a deep dive into patient-specific details such as age, 
contributing variables, and other pertinent factors. The comprehensive exploration and discussion of 
these aspects within this paper will guide the design and content of the envisioned dashboards, 
ultimately enhancing our understanding of chronic diseases and enabling effective data visualization for 
informed decision-making.
